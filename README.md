review Juypter Notebook tips and tricks
- make many cells if you are trying out new code
-- this helps to ensure the code that takes processing power doesn't get called repeatedly (example: imports, file reads, loops)

- Add # Descriptors to your code often to remind yourself what those lines are doing
- Keep code that expresses a thought together 

- When working with Pandas, start with making a master table variable, then make new tables that suit your needs without changing the origin; this allows you to review the details for accuracy and limits the chance for data corruption
